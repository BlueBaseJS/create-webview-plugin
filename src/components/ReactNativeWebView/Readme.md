**React Native WebView** is a modern, well-supported, and cross-platform WebView for React Native. It is intended to be a replacement for the built-in WebView


# React Native WebView Getting Started Guide

Here's how to get started quickly with the React Native WebView.

#### 1. Add react-native-webview to your dependencies

```
$ yarn add react-native-webview
```

#### 2. Link native dependencies

React Native modules that include native Objective-C, Swift, Java, or Kotlin code have to be "linked" so that the compiler knows to include them in the app.

This module does not require any extra step after running the link command ðŸŽ‰
```
$ react-native link react-native-webview
```
For Android manual installation, please refer to [this article](https://engineering.brigad.co/demystifying-react-native-modules-linking-964399ec731b) where you can find detailed step on how to link any react-native project.

For iOS, while you can manually link the old way using [react-native own tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios), we find it easier to use cocoapods.
If you wish to use cocoapods and haven't set it up yet, please instead refer to [that article](https://engineering.brigad.co/demystifying-react-native-modules-linking-ae6c017a6b4a).

_NOTE: If you ever need to uninstall React Native WebView, run `react-native unlink react-native-webview` to unlink it._

#### 3. Import the webview into your component

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

class MyWeb extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        source={{uri: 'https://infinite.red'}}
        style={{marginTop: 20}}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Minimal example with inline HTML:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

class MyInlineWeb extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        originWhitelist={['*']}
        source={{ html: '<h1>Hello world</h1>' }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```
